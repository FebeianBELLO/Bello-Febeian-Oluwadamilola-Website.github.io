									FEBEIAN</h1>
									<p> A Detail-Oriented Data Analyst and Scientist.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/image mee.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p> <p> AS a passionate  Data analyst and Data scientist with a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and financial modeling. My journey began at the University of Ilorin, Nigeria, where I earned a degree in Mathematics, followed by a master’s degree in Actuarial science from the University of Lagos, Nigeria, specializing in risk assessment and  analysis. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, I earned a Diploma in Applied Data Science Lab from WorldQuant University (USA), where I worked on real-world data projects, further sharpening my analytical and problem-solving skills.</p>
                                    <p>Driven by a passion for transforming data into actionable insights, I have honed my expertise in Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, leveraging these tools for data visualization, machine learning, financial modeling, portfolio optimization, and risk analysis. My goal is to use data-driven solutions to empower businesses, drive strategic decision-making, and unlock growth opportunities across industries.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Through my experience at Mentorness as a Data Analyst Intern, I applied critical thinking and problem-solving to analyze datasets, clean and validate records, and visualize key insights that enhanced operational efficiency. By leveraging SQL and PowerBI, I identified critical project trends, helping stakeholders make informed decisions. I also developed the ability to translate complex data into meaningful business insights using storytelling, structured presentations, and visual aids, improving engagement and decision-making.

                                        <p>Beyond technical expertise, I have developed strong collaboration and workflow management skills. At Tasty Arena, I worked closely with cross-functional teams to streamline project execution, improve efficiency, and optimize resources. I applied data-driven decision-making by analyzing project schedules and labor costs, leading to cost reductions and improved operational performance. These experiences sharpened my ability to work with diverse teams, communicate effectively, and drive efficiency.</p>          
                                    <p> I recognize the importance of adaptability and continuous learning. I have refined my professional and workflow management skills through ALX Africa’s Virtual Assistant and AI Career Essentials courses, preparing myself for dynamic and fast-evolving business environments.</p>

									<p> I am driven by a vision to continuously expand my knowledge in data science, AI, and finance. My ultimate goal is to leverage data-driven solutions to solve complex business problems and make a meaningful impact in the industry.</p>
